      <p>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary who participated in the
        mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian
        nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a
        hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a
        household name in the Punjab region,
        and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism
        and anarchism, he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection
        within the Indian National Congress's
        nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.</p>
      <p>In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group,
        the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police
        officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on
        probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.
        They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
        ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks
        thereafter died of a heart attack.
        As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the
        street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the
        postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an
        Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.</p>

        <li><b>Special Tribunal</b>
          <p>To speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an
            ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This decision cut
            short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located
            in
            England.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Appeal to the Privy Council</b>
          <p>In Punjab province, a defence committee drew up a plan to appeal to the Privy Council. Singh was initially
            against the appeal but later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularise the HSRA in Britain.
            The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the tribunal was invalid while the government
            countered that the Viceroy was completely empowered to create such a tribunal.
            The appeal was dismissed by Judge Viscount Dunedin.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Reactions to the judgement</b>
          <p>After the rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president Madan Mohan Malaviya filed
            a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February 1931.Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene.In
            his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded:
            While returning Gandhiji asked me if he could talk about the case of Bhagat Singh because newspapers had
            come out with the news of his slated hanging on March 24th. It would be a very unfortunate day because on
            that day the new president of the Congress had to reach Karachi and there would be a lot of hot discussion.
            I explained to him that I had given a very careful thought to it but I did not find any basis to convince
            myself to commute the sentence.
            It appeared he found my reasoning weighty.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Execution</b>
          <p>Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged
            on 24 March 1931.
            The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the
            Lahore jail.
            It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by
            law.
            The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also signed the three death warrants, as
            their original warrants had expired.
            The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly
            cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village,
            and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Ferozepore.</p>
